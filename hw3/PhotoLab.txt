Advanced.c
	Noise()
		It adds white noise to an image
		calculate the percentage of noise by p=WIDTH*HEIGHT*n/100;
		put white randamly by rand()%
	
	Sharpen()
		1. create templare file for R, G, B
		2. set a, b, c as 
		-1 -1 -1
		-1  9 -1
		-1 -1 -1
		3. change to 255 if a, b, c are over 255 and change to 0 if a, b, c are negative
		4. give the value back
	
	Posterize()
		1. do right shift and left shift for R, G, B by rbits, gbits, bbits each
		2. left shift until the (rbits-1, gbits-1, bbits-1)th number
		
	Motion Blur()
		R G B = half original value + averaged from bluramount to the right
		1. half orginal value = 1/2*R, 1/2*G, 1/2*B
		2. by using for loop, R[x+i] til bluramount
		3. divided by bluramount
		4. add these 1 and 3
